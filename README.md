- Standard analog clock face for Fitbit Versa 3 and Ionic with some stats along the bottom of the screen, day and date on the right hand side. The stats included are steps, heart rate and battery.

- The clock face uses roman numerals as well in place of numbers. 

- The companion app and settings directories have been removed for simplicity, can be added back in for additional functionality further down the line.

- A preview of the clockface is below:
