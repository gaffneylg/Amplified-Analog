### **NOTE:** 
Due to 'EU regulations', Google have blocked 3rd party app/clockface installs on Fitbits since June 2024. The workaround to this is to use a VPN set to outside the EU to search and install for the whichever app/clockface you wish.

- Standard analog clock face for Fitbit Versa 3 and Sense with some stats along the bottom of the screen, day and date on the right hand side. The stats included are steps, heart rate and battery.

- The clock face uses roman numerals as well in place of numbers. 

- The companion app and settings directories have been removed for simplicity, can be added back in for additional functionality further down the line.

- A preview of the clockface is below:
